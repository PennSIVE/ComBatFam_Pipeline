\usage{
residual_gen(
  type,
  features,
  covariates,
  interaction = NULL,
  random = NULL,
  smooth = NULL,
  smooth_int_type = "linear",
  df,

}
\arguments{
\item{type}{A model function name that is to be used (eg: "lmer", "lm").}

\item{features}{Features/rois to extract residuals from. \emph{n x p} data frame or matrix of observations where \emph{p} is the number of features and \emph{n} is the number of subjects.}

\item{covariates}{Name of covariates supplied to \code{model}.}

\item{interaction}{Expression of interaction terms supplied to \code{model} (eg: "age*diagnosis").}

\item{random}{Variable name of a random effect in linear mixed effect model.}

\item{smooth}{Variable name that requires a smooth function.}

\item{smooth_int_type}{Indicates the type of interaction in \code{gam} models. By default, smooth_int_type is set to be "linear", representing linear interaction terms. "factor-smooth" represents categorical-continuous interactions and "tensor" represents interactions with different scales.}

\item{df}{Harmonized dataset to extract residuals from.}

\item{rm}{variables to remove effects from.}

\item{model}{A boolean variable indicating whether an existing model is to be used.}

\item{model_path}{path to the existing model.}

\item{cores}{number of cores used for parallel computing.}
}
\value{
\code{residual_gen} returns a list containing the following components:
\item{model}{a list of regression models for all rois}
\item{residual}{Residual dataframe}
}
\description{
Extract residuals after harmonization.
